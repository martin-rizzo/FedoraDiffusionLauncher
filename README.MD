# Fedora Diffusion Launcher
-->

This Bash script primarily addresses the compatibility issue between PyTorch
and Python v3.11 that arises during the installation of 'webui.sh'. The
incompatibility issue is indicated on the screen with the following error
message:

    ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torchvision==0.14.1+cu117 (from versions: 0.1.6, 0.1.7, 0.1.8, 0.1.9, 0.2.0, 0.2.1, 0.2.2, 0.2.2.post2, 0.2.2.post3) ERROR: No matching distribution found for torchvision==0.14.1+cu117 

Additionally, the script includes some basic checks and tips during the
installation process to avoid common issues.

## What is the compatibility issue about?

This issue arises because the version of PyTorch being used does not support
Python versions higher than v3.10. Fedora 37 includes a newer version that is
incompatible, and there is no easy way to downgrade it.

This script generates a virtual environment using "Python3.10", downloads
"webui.sh" from AUTOMATIC1111's official repository, and executes it within
the virtual environment.

The script attempts to automate this process as much as possible. However,
if any human intervention is necessary, it displays easily understandable
messages.

## Development status

The script is currently in an experimental phase, and while there is a functional version available, there are still adjustments and improvements being made to optimize its performance.

It is recommended that this version not be used in production or critical environments, but only for evaluation and testing purposes, as there may be limitations and errors that need to be resolved.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

## Usage

Use this script for both the initial installation and each subsequent attempt
to launch Stable Diffusion Web UI (at least until PyTorch becomes compatible
with the version of Python included in Fedora).

To initiate the installation and execution from scratch:

    ./sdlauncher.sh

To launch 'Stable Diffusion Web UI' egain once it is already installed:

    ./sdlauncher.sh
